  # Built from source rather than shipped as a cask: the app is signed ad-hoc,
  # and a downloaded ad-hoc bundle arrives quarantined and Gatekeeper-blocked.
  # Compiling here produces an unquarantined bundle and needs only the command
  # line tools Homebrew already requires.

  def install
    system "./build.sh"
    prefix.install "CursorWrap.app"
    # The pointer wrapping wants the bundle (see caveats), but the same binary
    # in the foreground is how --displays and --dry-run are meant to be used.
    bin.install_symlink prefix/"CursorWrap.app/Contents/MacOS/cursorwrap"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Accessibility is granted to the app bundle, not to the binary, so start
      cursorwrap with:

        open -a #{opt_prefix}/CursorWrap.app

      Approve it under System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility,
      then relaunch - a process denied at launch caches that answer and cannot
      pick up the grant:

        pkill -f CursorWrap.app
        open -a #{opt_prefix}/CursorWrap.app

      Every build is signed ad-hoc, so an upgrade invalidates the grant. After
      one, reset and re-approve:

        tccutil reset Accessibility dev.agrasso.cursorwrap

      To start it at login, see the "Run at login" section of the README, using
      #{opt_prefix}/CursorWrap.app as the path.
